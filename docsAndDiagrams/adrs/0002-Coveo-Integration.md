# Coveo integration

## Status

Pending

## Context

>Our code does not have a formatting library. Which means that there is not standard way that the code is formatted. This leads to a lot of time being wasted in code reviews and also makes it difficult to read the code.


## Decision

>Including coveo in our codebase. This will help us in formatting the code and also in code reviews.

## Consequences

>Developer productivity will increase. Code reviews will be faster and easier.
